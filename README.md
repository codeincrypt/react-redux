## Acknowledgements

We have created a blog for Redux in React JS, now we will implement a redux-thunk middleware in this project.

Redux-thunk is not alternate of Redux, but it extends Redux functionality and works as middleware by which we can keep our reducer code clean from API calls and once we get API response we can easily dispatch our event

We use package redux-thunk and add thunk as middleware in createStore.
